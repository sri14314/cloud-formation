# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Awesome CloudFormation list. 

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your issue or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/awesome-cloudformation/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/awesome-cloudformation/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. 

## Contributing new links via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't made a similar request already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source, focusing on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
4. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
5. Stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Updating your PR

If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Criteria for accepting items and links

We want to keep the quality of the links in our list as high as possible. In most cases, we will check for things like the following:

* Whether the project has been around for a long time, and how many stars, etc. it has garnered.
* Whether the project has had recent updates.
* Whether others in the community have commented on it (ideally, mostly positively).
* Whether the project has been archived, deprecated, or has missing assets or docs.
* Whether the submitted link goes to the project repository directly.  We prefer this as we want to do our part to promote and expose the project to new community members.

Consider if the item and link you are adding to the list is significantly useful for both new and experienced AWS CloudFormation users. In case we gather a lot of links that we find to not be useful, or get valid feedback to that effect, we may create another list within the repo for those.
